			<h3><a id="NOTE" name="NOTE"/>NOTE.</h3>
			<p>The Mystery which the author will always associate with this story is how he got through the task of writing it. It was written in a fortnight—day by day—to meet a sudden demand from the "Star," which made "a new departure" with it.</p>
			<p>The said fortnight was further disturbed by an extraordinary combined attack of other troubles and tasks. This is no excuse for the shortcomings of the book, as it was always open to the writer to revise or suppress it. The latter function may safely be left to the public, while if the work stands—almost to a letter—as it appeared in the "Star," it is because the author cannot tell a story more than once.</p>
			<p>The introduction of Mr. Gladstone into a fictitious scene is defended on the ground that he is largely mythical.</p>
